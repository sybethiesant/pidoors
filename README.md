PiDoors - A Wigand Access control system using Raspberri Pi.

This was a private project, I Figured i'd open it up to the public and see if there is any interest. Maybe some better ways to do things. 
How I have my system configured is 1 Pi runs the website and sql database. Then each door has its own pi. 
I created a simple PCB to for the PI and i will provide those files here as well.
